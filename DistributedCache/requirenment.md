# **Design a Distributed Cache**

You are asked to design and implement a **distributed cache system** that supports the following operations:

* `get(key)`  
* `put(key, value)`

## **Functional Requirements**

1. The cache is distributed across multiple cache nodes.  
2. The number of cache nodes should be configurable.  
3. When `get(key)` is called:  
   * If the key is present in the cache, return the value from the cache.  
   * If the key is not present in the cache, fetch the value from the database, store it in the cache, and then return it.  
4. When `put(key, value)` is called:  
   * The value should be stored in the appropriate cache node based on the distribution strategy.  
   * You may assume the database is also updated as needed, or clearly mention your assumption.

## **Design Requirements**

Your design should be flexible and extensible.

### **1\. Pluggable Distribution Strategy**

The system should support different strategies to decide **which cache node will store a given key**.

For the current implementation, students may use a simple approach such as:

* modulo-based distribution (`hash(key) % numberOfNodes`)  
* map-based routing

However, the design should allow plugging in a different strategy in the future, such as:

* **consistent hashing**

### **2\. Pluggable Eviction Policy**

Each cache node has limited capacity.

For the current version, the cache must use:

* **LRU (Least Recently Used)** eviction

But the design should allow switching to other eviction policies in the future, such as:

* **MRU (Most Recently Used)**  
* **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**

## **Expectations from the Candidate**

Your solution should include:

1. **Class diagram**  
2. **Code**  
3. Clear explanation of:  
   * how data is distributed across nodes  
   * how cache miss is handled  
   * how eviction works  
   * how the design supports future extensibility

## **Additional Notes / Assumptions**

* You may assume keys are unique.  
* You may assume the database interface is already available.  
* You do not need to implement real network communication between nodes; this is an in-memory LLD exercise.  
* Focus on clean object-oriented design and extensibility.
